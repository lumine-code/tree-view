# tree-view

Explore and open project files in a tree-like view of your directories.

## Features

- **Configurable click behavior**: open files and expand folders on single or double click.
- **Open externally**: alt-click a file to open it in an external program through the `open-external` service.
- **Flexible sorting**: choose locale-aware or natural sort, list folders before files, and group entries by base name.
- **Sticky navigation**: keep project roots and expanded ancestor directories visible while scrolling.
- **Native clipboard**: copy or cut entries across windows and external applications while preserving platform-specific duplicate names.
- **Responsive file operations**: copy and move entries in a separate process with a cancellable operation queue.
- **Debounced file watching**: rapid file creation and deletion is batched so the tree does not reload excessively.
- **Virtual root sections**: let external packages inject their own root sections above the project folders.

## Services

- [`tree-view.selection`](docs/tree-view.selection.md): provided to expose the selected paths, look up the entry element for a path, and reveal a path in the tree.
- [`tree-view.roots`](docs/tree-view.roots.md): provided to let external packages register virtual root sections above the project folders.

## Customization

Choose **Indent Guides** (the default) or **Classic** under the Tree View package settings. Classic uses conventional directory chevrons without hierarchy rails.

Adjust the tree's appearance by adding CSS to your `styles.css`. For example, to enlarge the entry text, loosen the row spacing, and restyle the indentation guides:

```css
.tree-view {
  font-size: 14px;
  line-height: 1.6;
  --tree-view-indent-size: 18px;
  --tree-view-indent-guide-color: var(--text-color-subtle);
}
```
